Creating a deep learning network in Python involves several steps and can get quite complex depending on the architecture and the task. Here, I'll guide you through writing a program for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. We'll use TensorFlow and Keras to build this network.

Steps:
Import Libraries
Load and Preprocess Data
Build the CNN Model
Compile the Model
Train the Model
Evaluate the Model
Make Predictions
